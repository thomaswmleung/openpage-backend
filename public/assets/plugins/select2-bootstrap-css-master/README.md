# Select2 Bootstrap CSS

Simple CSS to make Select2 widgets fit in with Bootstrap.  

* NOTE: This is the legacy repo. You probably want the official one here: https://github.com/select2/select2-bootstrap-theme

--------------------------------------------------



* This branch (`master`) contains the legacy version for Bootstrap 2.  
* The legacy bootstrap 3 branch is here: [`bootstrap3` branch](https://github.com/t0m/select2-bootstrap-css/tree/bootstrap3).*

The LESS file is located at lib/select2-bootstrap.less, and the SCSS file is located at lib/select2-bootstrap.scss.

Tests are included to verify that LESS and SCSS compile down to the target CSS. To run the tests, you'll need to install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Less](http://lesscss.org/), and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/). Then you can run:

    npm install && bower install
    npm test

## Notable Changes

Versions prior to 1.2.0 included a default width for select2 containers. Applying the class "input-default" to your select will line the select2 container up with a default bootstrap text input.

## Compass

This library can also be used as a [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) plugin.

Gemfile:

    gem 'select2-bootstrap-css'

compass.rb:

    require 'select2-bootstrap-css'

Your scss file:

    @import 'select2-bootstrap';
